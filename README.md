# eDNA Monitoring of Marine Vertebrates in Northern California Protected Areas

This repository contains scripts and supporting materials for our study examining vertebrate community composition in and around Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Northern California using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding.

A subset of eDNA samples are paired with community angling surveys.
