# eDNA Monitoring of Marine Vertebrates in Northern California Protected Areas

This repository contains working versions of scripts and supporting materials for in-progress research examining vertebrate community composition in and around Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Northern California. MPAs and reference sites were sampled for analysis using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. Metabarcoding libraries were prepared using 3 markers that target teleost fishes and 1 marker that targets rockfishes (_Sebastes_ spp.), a diverse and locally important group of temperate reef fishes.

A subset of eDNA samples are paired with community angling surveys.
