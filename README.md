# Northern California MPA eDNA Project

This repository contains supporting materials for our study examining vertebrate community composition in and around marine protected areas (MPAs) in Northern California using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding.

A subset of eDNA samples are paired with community angling surveys.
